<!-- is js single threaded -> yes -->
<!-- is nodejs single threaded -> Yes  -->
<!-- multithreading -> internally -> libuv-->
<!-- async architecture-->
# notes 
* Every piece of JS code will only execute on callStack
* Asynchronous functions are given by your enviornment
* Asynchronous are invoked on callStack but are executed in web/node API


## first medium to do asynchronous programming -> cb
    ### disadvantages ->  callback hell
            *  nesting of code 
            * inversion of control 
    ### Alternative:   Promises
